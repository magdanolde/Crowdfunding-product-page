## CROWDFUNDING PRODUCT PAGE

### :shell: PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL

It is one of the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges, which help to improve the coding skills by building realistic projects.
This challenge was to build out a crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### :unlock: FEATURES 

Users should be able to:

* View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for interactive elements
* Make a selection of which pledge to make
* See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
* See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
* Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

###  SOLUTIONS APPLIED IN THE PROJECT

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* SASS
* Flexbox
* Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* BEM patterns
* Vanilla JS

It was a fantastic project for honing my recently acquired SASS skills.

Due to mastering of the <dialog> tag, I successfully implemented modals/popups in the project. Utilizing the showModal() method allowed me to open the modals seamlessly. I also had the opportunity to style a ::backdrop pseudo-element for added visual appeal. The close() method played a crucial role in enabling modal closure. Kevin Powell's tutorial video served as my primary source of guidance throughout this process.

Furthermore, I took the chance to revisit and solidify my understanding of grid layouts and grid-template-areas.

Expanding beyond styling, I delved into utilizing media queries in JavaScript and learned a useful skill‚Äîconverting strings with commas to numbers and vice versa using toLocaleString("en-IN") and .replace(/,/g, '').

###  SOLUTIONS I STILL WANT TO ADD 

As for future enhancements, I plan to incorporate additional transitions for the modals, enhancing the overall user experience. Additionally, I discovered that the @import directive in SASS is considered outdated. In my upcoming projects, I am committed to adopting the more modern and efficient practices of @use and @forward.
